#### Hosting on Cloudflare Pages

Cloudflare Pages provides an easy-to-use platform to deploy and scale your websites and applications directly from your GitHub repository. It's a great choice for hosting static Gatsby projects.

##### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account
- A Cloudflare account

##### Step-by-step guide

1. **Navigate to Cloudflare Pages dashboard**

Log into Cloudflare and navigate to the Cloudflare Pages dashboard.

2. **Create a new project**

Click the 'Create a project' button.

3. **Connect your GitHub account**

If it's your first time using Cloudflare Pages, you'll need to authorize access to your GitHub account. This allows Cloudflare Pages to deploy your commits.

4. **Select the appropriate GitHub repository**

Select the repository you wish to deploy in Cloudflare Pages.

5. **Configure your project**

On the next screen, you'll need to configure your project:
  - **Project name:** This will determine the subdomain of your site (`<project-name>.pages.dev`).
  - **Production branch:** Typically, this is the `main` or `master` branch of your repository.
  - **Build settings:** For a Gatsby project, the Build command should be `npm run build` or `gatsby build`, and the Build output directory should be `public/`.

6. **Click on the 'Save and Deploy' button**

Cloudflare Pages will deploy your site for the first time. This might take a couple of minutes.

After the deployment is successful, you'll receive a unique subdomain for your project under `pages.dev`. You can also set up a custom domain if you prefer.

For more detailed information, refer to the [official Cloudflare Pages documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/getting-started).

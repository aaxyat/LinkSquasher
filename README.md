## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (>=14)
- Gatsby CLI

### Installation
1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aaxyat/LinkSquasher.git
    ```
2. Install NPM packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Configuration
Edit the `redirects.json` file at the /data . The format should be:
```json
{
 { "shortUrl": "customname", "longUrl": "https://example.com" },
}
```
For example:
```json
{
  { "shortUrl": "google", "longUrl": "https://google.com" }
}
```
With the above configuration, when someone navigates to `yoursite.com/google`, they will be redirected to `https://www.google.com`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment

1. Build the static site:
    ```bash
    gatsby build
